API management is the process of creation, control, and troubleshooting of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). It is accomplished by way of a combination of tools and services to support the provisioning, securing, maintenance, and analysis of APIs.

The Axway API Management (APIM) solution provides an interface that allows developers inside and outside the organization to access documentation, implement the proper methods to call an API, know what response to expect, and ease the process of onboarding the API to be published for use.

The benefits of API management include:

* **Agility**: allows organizations to easily create, share, monitor, and adjust APIs without unnecessary costs or undue loss of productivity.
* **Workflow automation**: Simplifies API related tasks by enabling businesses to automate a range of operations and minimize manual tasks.
* **Data-driven growth**: Provides analytic tools that allow organizations to track API usage, gather and analyze usage data, and make informed strategic decisions.
* **Security**: Helps to secure data and user information transferred over APIs by tracking API usage and initiating the integration of security protocols, such as OAuth, JWT, and so on. API Management can provide additional security benefits by securing access to applications.
* **Centralized control**: Provides centralized control over API integrations, ensuring they continuously meet high security and performance standards.
