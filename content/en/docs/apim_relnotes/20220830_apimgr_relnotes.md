---
API Gateway and API Manager updates are cumulative, comprising new features and changes delivered in previous updates unless specifically indicated otherwise in the Release notes.

In this release, we're adding some user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) improvements, additional support for YAML, externalisation of the configuration for the Admin Node Manager, and the capability to use FIPS with Open SSL 3.0. We keep working to make Amplify API Management a top solution that helps you to control of all your APIs and events across gateways, vendors, and environments!

## Installation

* To **update** your API Gateway, see [Update from API Gateway One Version](/docs/apim_installation/apigw_upgrade/upgrade_steps_oneversion/).
* To **upgrade** from an older version, see [Upgrade from API Gateway 7.5.x or 7.6.x](/docs/apim_installation/apigw_upgrade/upgrade_steps_extcass/).
* For more details on supported platforms for software installation, see [System requirements](/docs/apim_installation/apigtw_install/system_requirements/).
* For a summary of the system requirements for a Docker deployment, see [Set up Docker environment](/docs/apim_installation/apigw_containers/docker_scripts_prereqs/).

### Update a container deployment

Any custom `.fed` files deployed to a container must be upgraded using [upgradeconfig](/docs/apim_installation/apigw_upgrade/upgrade_analytics#upgradeconfig-options) or [projupgrade](/docs/apim_reference/devopstools_ref#projupgrade-command-options). They must be upgraded the same way, regardless of whether they are API Manager enabled or not. The `.fed` files contain the updates for the API Manager configuration and can be used to build containers.

## New features and enhancements

The following new features and enhancements are available in this update.

### Configure a Node Manager Docker container to use a persisted volume for Node Manager configuration

This feature enhancement allows a Node Manager in container mode to be reconfigured without the need to rebake its Docker image. Configuration updates such as policy changes, JVM system properties, environment properties and so on, can now be mounted on a Docker Volume and made available to a Node Manager container. For more information, see [Create an API Gateway with Docker volumes](/docs/apim_howto_guides/configuring_apigw_container/).

### YAML and Policy Studio

As part of our work to facilitate YAML configuration, with this update YAML is now supported in Policy Studio with specific enhancements made in Environmentalisation.

## Important changes

It is important, especially when upgrading from an earlier version, to be aware of the following changes in the behavior or operation of the product in this update, which may impact your current installation.

### Reintroduction of Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS)

FIPS capabilities have been reintroduced into API Gateway combined with an upgrade of OpenSSL 3.0.5.

Enabling FIPS restricts cryptographic cipher options pertaining to message encryption and decryption and signature and verification, and it also increases the minimum key length size to those approved by the [Federal Information Processing Standard (140-2)](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.140-2.pdf).

For more information, see [Restrictions when running in FIPS mode](/docs/apim_administration/apigtw_admin/admin_fips).

Reintroducing FIPS also resulted in changes to the `openssl.cnf` file. The `default_sect` and `legacy_sect` options are now disabled by default in the `INSTALL_DIR/apigateway/conf/openssl.cnf` file.

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}Upgrading an existing API Gateway will overwrite the `conf/openssl.cnf` file with required FIPS changes. Any custom configuration must be backed up. For more information, see [Upgrade API Gateway](/docs/apim_installation/apigw_upgrade/upgrade_steps_oneversion){{< /alert >}}

The bundled XML Security Library does not contain the changes required to use the OpenSSL 3.0 FIPS module. As a consequence, XML encryption and signing are not guaranteed to be FIPS compliant.

Hardware Security Module (HSM) usage is not supported in FIPS mode. It is intended that support will be introduced in a future release.

### Policy Studio and Configuration Studio update process

During the Policy Studio and Configuration Studio update process, the `plugins` directory is deleted and then recreated with the new plugins. Therefore, any custom plugins added to this directory is removed.

For more information, see [Install a Policy Studio update](/docs/apim_installation/apigw_upgrade/upgrade_steps_oneversion#install-a-policy-studio-update) and [Install a Configuration Studio update](/docs/apim_installation/apigw_upgrade/upgrade_steps_oneversion#install-a-configuration-studio-update).

### HTTP cookie validation

API Gateway validates HTTP cookies as per RFC 6265. A new `com.axway.apigw.cookie.validation.ignore` Java system property has been added to bypass cookie validation introduced in [API Gateway May 2021](/docs/apim_relnotes/20210530_apimgr_relnotes/) release. When the property is set to `true`, API Gateway skips cookie validation.

For more information, see [System property changes](/docs/apim_reference/system_props/).

### HTTP Redirect and Connect to URL filters fail URLs containing non-encoded characters

The **HTTP Redirect** filter now fails URLs containing non-encoded CRLF characters with an `Internal Server Error` instead of passing with a `301 Moved Permanently` response with no location header.

The **Connect to URL filter** now fails URLs containing non-encoded trailing CRLF characters with an `Internal Server Error` instead of passing the trimmed URL without the trailing CRLF characters to the server.

For more information, see [HTTP redirect filter](/docs/apim_policydev/apigw_polref/routing_additional#http-redirect-filter) and [Connect to URL filter](/docs/apim_policydev/apigw_polref/routing_common#connect-to-url-filter).

### Organization administrator self-service API publishing

When Self-service API publishing is enabled, Organization administrators can access APIs for the organizations they are a member of or have been granted access to. Previously, when self-service was enabled, API Manager incorrectly allowed access to APIs in other organizations even when no API access was granted.

Customer's scripts or client applications might now fail to get APIs from other organizations if the Organization administrators have not been granted access to these APIs.

For more information, see [API Manager access control, Organization administrator](/docs/api_mgmt_overview/key_concepts/api_mgmt_orgs_roles#organizationadministrator).

### API Gateway expression language resolver changed

The expression language resolver, which is used to resolve selector statements, was loading multiple expression resolvers into the API Gateway instance, leading to unpredictable behavior. This has been fixed to always use the JUEL API resolver.

### CSP header updated

The default CSP header has been changed to improve security and remove references to unused Axway assets. If you have a custom CSP header defined, see the new defaults.

For API Manager

```bash
script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval'; img-src 'self' data: blob:; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; font-src 'self' data: blob:; object-src 'self'; media-src 'self'; frame-src 'self'; frame-ancestors 'none'; upgrade-insecure-requests; manifest-src 'none'; connect-src 'self' https://*:8075 https://*:8065 https://portals-search-api.admin.axway.com; form-action 'self'; prefetch-src 'none'
```

For API Gateway Manager

```bash
script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval'; img-src 'self' data: blob:; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; font-src 'self' data: blob:; object-src 'self'; media-src 'self'; frame-src 'self';frame-ancestors 'none'; upgrade-insecure-requests; manifest-src 'none'; connect-src 'self' https://portals-search-api.admin.axway.com; form-action 'self'; prefetch-src 'none'
```

For API Gateway Analytics

```bash
script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval'; img-src 'self' data: blob:; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; font-src 'self' data: blob:; object-src 'self'; media-src 'self'; frame-src 'self'; frame-ancestors 'none'; upgrade-insecure-requests; manifest-src 'none'; connect-src 'self'; form-action 'self'; prefetch-src 'none'
```

For more information, see [Define a restrictive Content Security Policy](/docs/apim_installation/apiportal_install/secure_harden_portal#define-a-restrictive-content-security-policy).

### New Cassandra user script

A new script has been added to help in creating new users in Cassandra. It is located at `apigateway/samples/cassandrauser/scripts/createuser.sh`. For more information, see [Create a new Cassandra database user](/docs/cass_admin/admin_cassandra_classic/cassandra_config#create-a-new-cassandra-database-user).

### Disable connection cache for LDAP authentication using Auth Repository

Setting the cache refresh interval of a LDAP authentication via Auth Repository will now disable the cache altogether. For more information, see [General settings in Policy Studio](/docs/apim_reference/general_settings/index.html)

### OpenJDK JRE update to v8u345

API Gateway 7.7 and API Manager 7.7 support OpenJDK JRE. This update includes Zulu OpenJDK v8u345.

### Apache XalanJ is removed

The CVE-2022-34169 was found in apache XalanJ prior to this release, with no fix available. To mitigate this issue, we have updated API Gateway to use a version of Xalan shipped with Zulu JRE that has been patched for this CVE. To use the patched version of Xalan in scripts and filters, you must replace the `org.apache.xalan.xsltc.trax.TransformerFactoryImpl` property with `com.sun.org.apache.xalan.internal.xsltc.trax.TransformerFactoryImpl`.

This replacement is also needed to update the transformer factory library in customer modified ./system/conf/jvm.xml files.

## Deprecated features

No features have been deprecated in this update.

## End of support notices

There are no end of support notices in this update.

## Removed features

<!--To stay current and align our offerings with customer demand and best practices, Axway might discontinue support for some capabilities. As part of this update, the following features have been removed:-->

## Known issues

The following are known issues for this update.

### EdDSA certificates are not currently supported

TLS and PKI certificates using EdDSA signatures (`ed25519` and `ed448`) for authentication are not currently supported within API Gateway. Certificates cannot be imported into the `config` file, and connections are not be established with external endpoints that use EdDSA certificates.

Related Issue: RDAPI-28033

### API Analytics PDF reports do not display chart contents

In API Analytics, the PDF reports no longer correctly display the contents of the charts. This issue has arisen due to a security upgrade of the `Highcharts.js` charting library. We are working on the fix of this functionality, to be released in a future update of API Gateway.

Related Issue: RDAPI-27301

### Scripting filter whiteboard attributes not preloaded for Jython scripts

The Scripting filter now uses a Jython 2.7 scripting environment (previously, Jython 2.5) to execute Jython scripts. As a result of this version change, the whiteboard attributes, such as `http.request.uri` and `http.request.verb`, are no longer preloaded for use by Jython scripts. However, you can run a Jython script to load these attributes before they are accessed as follows:

```
from com.vordel.trace import Trace

def invoke(msg):
    msg.forceGenerateAttributes()
    Trace.info("This trace statement was generated in script filter!  [" + str(msg.get("http.request.verb")) + "] [" + str(msg.get("http.request.uri")) + "]")
    return True
```

### API Gateway web service WSDL schema validation failure

If a web service is defined using multiple WSDLs, an error of 'Cannot find the declaration of element' might occur during the schema validation of a SOAP message. This might happen because of a duplication of the WSDLs types schema `targetNamespace`. To avoid this failure, you must change the types schema `targetNamespace` to be unique across the WSDLs.

### API Catalog Swagger 2.0 export issue when multiple API Manager traffic ports configured

When exporting Swagger 2.0 from API Manager Catalog with multiple traffic ports defined, if you try to subsequently reimport the generated document into another API Manager, the back-end URLs (HTTP and HTTPS) are correctly generated but the port will be incorrect for one of the URLs.

The issue is caused by an inherent flaw in Swagger 2.0 as it only permits one host to be specified. At export time, API Manager takes the first SSL-based basePath, if one exists, from the list of available basePaths (host:port) and applies that to the `$.host` field in the resultant Swagger 2.0 definition.

For example, if an HTTPS traffic port of `8065` and an HTTP traffic port of `8066` are configured, and the host IP address is `127.0.0.1`, then the generated Swagger 2.0 definition will look like this:

```json
{
  "swagger" : "2.0",
  "info" : {
    "description" : "",
    "version" : "1.0.3",
    "title" : "Test API"
  },
  "host" : "127.0.0.1:8065",
  "basePath" : "/api",
  "schemes" : [ "https", "http" ],
  "paths" : {...}
}
```

Note that the `$.host` field specifies a port of 8065. Importing this definition back into API Manager will result in the following back-end URLs, with the HTTP port being incorrect.

* `https://127.0.0.1:8065/api`
* `http://127.0.0.1:8065/api`

The recommendation is to use OpenAPI, which has the ability to specify multiple back-end hosts. For more information, see [OpenAPI Specification, Server Object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.2.md#serverObject).

Related Issue: RDAPI-23379

### When multiple API Manager traffic ports are configured, specifying a virtual host that contains a host and port can cause conflicting base path URLs to be displayed in API Catalog

In API Manager, if a virtual host (global default, organization level, or for a published API) is set to `myhost` and there are multiple traffic ports (mix of HTTP and HTTPS) configured, API Manager correctly displays `https://myhost` and `http://myhost` as base path URLs in the API Catalog.

An issue only arises when a port is specified as part of the virtual host. API Manager blindly takes the specified virtual host and appends it to the supported schemes for the configured traffic ports. So if a virtual host of `myhost:9999` is set, then conflicting base paths of `https://myhost:9999` and `http://myhost:9999` are displayed in the API Catalog.
