API Gateway enables you to remove sensitive content from messages monitored in the API Gateway Manager web console and traffic monitoring database. You can redact sensitive content  in messages such as HTTP headers, JSON, XML, HTML form, and plain text.

For example, sensitive data such as user passwords or credit card details can be redacted from both request and response messages. This means that such sensitive data is only ever present in API Gateway memory during message processing, and is never displayed onscreen or persisted to disk. This is shown in the following architecture diagram:

![Redact sensitive message content from API Gateway](/Images/APIGateway/admin_redaction.png)

## API Gateway redaction configuration

API Gateway installs a set of default rules that are applied to existing services such as Traffic Monitor, API Manager, and OAuth. In a new installation, API Gateway has default redaction rules for both Node Manager and group instances.

The default redaction files are located at:

```none
apigateway/system/conf/nodemanagerRedaction.xml
```

```none
apigateway/skel/instanceRedaction.xml
```

When a new instance is created, the default instance redaction file is copied to the following location and no further configuration is required:

```none
apigateway/groups/GROUP/INSTANCE/conf/instanceRedaction.xml
```

On upgrading an existing installation, the files are extracted to the locations above, and existing instances are not updated.

### Copy the default rules to an upgraded instance

To add the default rules to an upgraded instance, perform the following steps:

1. Copy the `instanceRedaction.xml` file to the `apigateway/groups/GROUP/INSTANCE/conf/` folder.
2. Add a reference to it in the `apigateway/groups/GROUP/INSTANCE/conf/service.xml` file. For example:

    ```xml
    <if exists="$VINSTDIR/conf/instanceRedaction.xml">
        <include file="$VINSTDIR/conf/instanceRedaction.xml"/>
    </if>
    ```

### Configure additional custom rules in a single instance

Follow this section to configure additional custom rules in a single instance's configuration, by adding a reference to include a *custom rules* file within the `apigateway/groups/GROUP/INSTANCE/conf/service.xml` file.

1. Create a new redaction rules file, for example, `apigateway/groups/GROUP/INSTANCE/conf/redaction.xml`.
2. Add a reference to the new file in the `apigateway/groups/GROUP/INSTANCE/conf/service.xml` file. For example:

    ```xml
    <if exists="$VINSTDIR/conf/redaction.xml">
        <include file="$VINSTDIR/conf/redaction.xml"/>
    </if>
    ```

    Modifying the default files is not recommended as future upgrades might overwrite these files.

### Reuse custom rules in multiple instances

If you wish to use the same redaction rules file for multiple instances, you can instead put the *custom rules* file into `apigateway/conf/redaction.xml`, then reference it in `service.xml`. For example:

```xml
<if exists="$VDISTDIR/conf/redaction.xml">
    <include file="$VDISTDIR/conf/redaction.xml"/>
</if>
```

The `$VDISTDIR` variable refers to the API Gateway installation directory (for example, `apigateway/`), whereas the `$VINSTDIR` variable refers to the home directory of the instance (for example, `apigateway/groups/GROUP/INSTANCE/`).

### Disable default rules

To disable default rules, remove the redaction rules file, or its reference, from the `service.xml`. To disable individual rules, see section [Disable default redaction rules](#disable-default-redaction-rules).

## Define redaction rules

After the configuration is loaded, redactors are created for the specified message protocol and content. This XML-based configuration uses the following model:

```xml
<Redaction enabled="true" name="First Redactor" provider="redactors">
    <HTTPRedactor>...</HTTPRedactor>
    <JSONRedactor>...</JSONRedactor>
    <RawRedactor>...</RawRedactor>
    <XMLRedactor>...</XMLRedactor>
    <FormRedactor>...</FormRedactor>
    <TraceRedactor>...</TraceRedactor>
</Redaction >
<Redaction enabled="true" name="Another Redactor" provider="redactors">
    <HTTPRedactor>...</HTTPRedactor>
</Redaction >
```

You can create multiple redaction groups to segregate redaction by URLs and redaction types. The `HTTPRedactor` element is required in each redactor because it lists all URLs for which content redaction rules are applied to. You must add only one `HTTPRedactor` element per redaction group. All other content redactors elements are optional. Parameter `name` is optional in a redaction definition, and its default value is `Redaction_n`, where "n" starts at 1 and is increased for each redaction group loaded from configuration.

The redaction groups fragments can be loaded from different files, but the order in which configuration files are loaded and the order in which groups are declared within a single file matter. During a transaction processing, for each traffic monitoring stream, a chain of redactors is created for redacting data which is received and sent. Each redactor removes any sensitive data that it finds, then passes the data for the next redactor for processing. Based on product configuration, the redacted content is written to traffic monitoring database or to product traces.

You must always configure a redaction group so that redacted data is not corrupted and respects the formatting expected by the next redaction groups.

Each redactor defines its supported content types using `RedactMime` elements. In a given redaction group there should be only one redactor defined for a given content type; if multiple are defined, an error message is logged. The following example shows content types for a JSON redactor:

```xml
<JSONRedactor>
    <RedactMime mimeType="application/json"/>
    <RedactMime mimeType="text/json"/>
     ...
</JSONRedactor>
```

## Enable customized redaction for an API Gateway

To enable redaction for an API Gateway instance, perform the following steps:

1. Copy the sample redaction configuration file from the following directory:

   ```none
   apigateway/samples/redaction/sample_redaction.xml
   ```
2. Copy to the following directory:

   ```none
   apigateway/groups/GROUP/INSTANCE/conf/redaction.xml
   ```
3. Ensure that redaction elements are enabled in `redaction.xml` as follows:

   ```xml
   <ConfigurationFragment>
   <Redaction enabled="true">
   ...
   </Redaction>
   </ConfigurationFragment>
   ```
4. You can customize this file to configure redactors for different message payloads (HTTP, JSON, HTML form, and plain text), but you must ensure that you have an `HTTPRedactor` that specifies which URLs redaction will be applied to. This is described in the next sections.
5. Edit the following file:

   ```none
    apigateway/groups/GROUP/INSTANCE/conf/service.xml
   ```
6. Add the following line at the end of the file:

   ```xml
   <NetService provider="NetService">
      ...
      <include file="$VINSTDIR/conf/redaction.xml"/>
   </NetService>
   ```
   Ensure the added line is the last in the series, as shown in this example.

7. Restart the API Gateway instance.

## Disable default redaction rules

Disabling default redaction rules is not recommended because they hide sensitive pieces of data that would be otherwise logged.

To disable default redaction of an instance, edit the `apigateway/groups/GROUP/INSTANCE/conf/instanceRedaction.xml` file and replace parameters `enabled="true"` with `enabled="false"`. For example:

   ```xml
   <ConfigurationFragment>
     <Redaction enabled="false" name="Instance Global Redaction" provider="redactors">
       ...
     </Redaction>
     <Redaction enabled="false" name="Instance currentuser API Redaction">
       ...
     </Redaction>
     <Redaction enabled="false" name="Instance oauth API Redaction">
       ...
     </Redaction>
   </ConfigurationFragment>
   ```

To disable default redaction of node manager, edit the `apigateway/system/conf/nodemanagerRedaction.xml` file and replace parameters `enabled="true"` with `enabled="false"`. For example:

   ```xml
   <ConfigurationFragment>
     <Redaction enabled="false" name="Node Manager Global Redaction" provider="redactors">
       ...
     </Redaction>
     <Redaction enabled="false" name="Node Manager login API Redaction">
       ...
     </Redaction>
     <Redaction enabled="false" name="Node Manager adminusers API Redaction">
       ...
     </Redaction>
   </ConfigurationFragment>
   ```

To disable custom redaction, modify the custom file (for example, `redaction.xml`) as follows:

```xml
<ConfigurationFragment>
<Redaction enabled="false" provider="redactors">
...
</ConfigurationFragment>
```

## Redact HTTP message content

You must specify an `HTTPRedactor` element with the URLs you wish to enable redaction on within the redaction configuration. Redaction rules are only processed for URLs listed in one of the `HTTPURL` values. Other elements have no effect if an `HTTPRedactor` is not defined.

You can redact any HTTP header or parameter value from the API Gateway message stream based on HTTP URLs specified in the configuration. This applies to both HTTP requests and responses.

The following example, configured in the `redaction.xml` file, specifies the following:

* Obfuscate the `credit_card` query string parameter
* Replace the value of `password` query string parameter with `***`
* Remove the `Authorization` header from messages sent to and from the `/payment` URL

```xml
<HTTPRedactor>
   <HTTPURL value="/payment" match="prefix"/>
   <HTTPParam value="credit_card" action="obfuscate" keepFirst="0" keepLast="0"/>
   <HTTPParam value="password" action="replace" replaceBy="***"/>
   <HTTPHeader value="Authorization" action="remove"/>
</HTTPRedactor>
```

`HTTPHeader` applies the `action` type redaction to HTTP headers named `value` parameter. A regular expression can be used to match multiple headers; to do so, replace the `value` parameter with a `regex` parameter. For example:

```xml
<HTTPHeader regex="X-TryIt-Cookie-.*" action="obfuscate"/>
```

The action type of fields `HTTPHeader`, `HTTPParam`, and `FormField` can be one of the following:

* `remove`: Removes the field completely (name and value).
* `replace`: Replaces the field value with the value defined in the tag parameter `replacedBy`.
* `obfuscate`: Replaces the field value's characters with `\*`.

If the `action` parameter is not set in tag `HTTPParam`, the default action is `replace` and the default value for `replaceBy` is the string `null`.

If the `action` parameter is not set in tag `HTTPHeader`, the default action is `remove`.

Obfuscation of the `value` parameter can be modified using extra tag parameters:

* `keepFirst="n"`: The first `n` number of characters are not obfuscated. Defaults to `0`.
* `keepLast="n"`: The last `n` number of characters are not obfuscated. Defaults to `0`.

Note that if the original data value is not longer than `n`, then `value` is not obfuscated.

### URL path matching

Each `HTTPURL` value is used to match URL paths and to determine if the redaction applies to the transaction. You can use the `match` attribute to specify a match for an exact URL path or for a URL prefix. The following example shows an exact URL path match:

```xml
<HTTPURL value="/secure_folder" match="exact"/>
```

In this exact match example:

* `/secure_folder` matches.
* `/secure_folder/` does not match.
* `/secure_folder/123` does not match.

The following example shows a URL prefix match:

```xml
<HTTPURL value="/creditcard/" match="prefix"/>
```

In this prefix match example:

* `/creditcard/` matches.
* `/creditcard/charge` matches.
* `/creditcard/charge/1234` matches.
* `/creditcard` does not match.

`HTTPURL` values are case sensitive. For example,

```xml
<HTTPURL value="/ORDER/shiptoaddress"/>
```

is different from:

```xml
<HTTPURL value="/order/shiptoaddress"/>
```

Finally, to define an `HTTPURL` that matches everything, use the following pattern:

```xml
<HTTPURL value="/" match="prefix"/>
```

### Supported HTTP features

The following HTTP features are supported:

* Chunked transfer encoding.
* Multipart body entities (`Content-Type:multipart/`).

#### Redact an HTTP Basic authorization header

This section shows an end-to-end example of redacting an HTTP basic authorization header. Given the following HTTP request message,

```xml
GET /securefiles/ HTTP/1.1
Host:www.httpwatch.com
Authorization:Basic aHR0cHdhdGNoOmY=
```

and the following HTTP redactor configuration,

```xml
<HTTPRedactor>
   <HTTPURL value="/securefiles/" match="exact"/>
   <HTTPHeader value="Authorization" action="remove"/>
</HTTPRedactor>
```

the HTTP message is redacted and stored in the traffic monitoring database as follows:

```xml
GET /securefiles/ HTTP/1.1
Host:www.httpwatch.com
```

If the action had been set to obfuscate (`action="obfuscate"`), the traffic monitoring database would contain:

```xml
GET /securefiles/ HTTP/1.1
Host:www.httpwatch.com
Authorization:**********************
```

Using the `replace` action and the `replaceBy` field (`action="replace" replaceBy="redacted"`) results in:

```xml
GET /securefiles/ HTTP/1.1
Host:www.httpwatch.com
Authorization:redacted
```

## Redact JSON message content

You can redact JSON content from a message by configuring a specific path to be removed. You can define a relative or absolute location for elements inside a JSON document. When you configure a specific path in the JSON redactor configuration, all elements found in that element are removed. The following general syntax is used to remove JSON content:

```xml
rule = path_seg [“.”path_seg]*
path_seg = wildcard/rel_wildcard/identifier/array_elem
array_elem = identifier ”[”wildcard/number“]”
identifier = char*
wildcard = “*”
rel_wildcard = “**”
```

The following examples show how this syntax works:

```xml
ca.b.c, a.*.c, a.**.c, **.b.c,**.b[0].c,**.b[*].c, *.b[0].*
```

This results in the following configuration model:

```xml
<JSONRedactor>
   <RedactMime mimeType="text/json"/>
    ...
   <JSONPath path="a.b.c"/>
   <JSONPath path="**.b[0].c"/>
</JSONRedactor>
```

### JSON redactor configuration

You can specify the following property in the `JSONRedactor` tag:

| Name          | Type   | Default value | Description                                           |
| ------------- | ------ | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| maxBufferSize | number | 32768         | Maximum memory size (in bytes) used by JSON redaction.|

For example:

```xml
<JSONRedactor maxBufferSize="32768">
   <RedactMime mimeType="application/json"/>
   ...
</JSONRedactor>
```

If an error occurs during the redaction process, including `maxBufferSize` reached, the JSON redactor redacts the rest of the JSON data being processed to avoid writing sensitive data to the logs.

The following shows an example from `redaction.xml`:

```xml
<JSONRedactor>
   <RedactMime mimeType="application/json"/>
   <JSONPath path="**.subject[0].id"/>
</JSONRedactor>
```

This example removes JSON content such as the following:

```xml
authentication.subject[0].id
cert.subject[0].id
attribute.subject[0].id
```

#### Example: Redact OAuth message tokens from a JSON message

This section shows an end-to-end example of redacting an OAuth message token. Given the following JSON request message,

```xml
{
   "access_token":"2YotnFZFEjr1zCsicMWpAA",
   "token_type":"example",
   "expires_in":3600,
   "refresh_token":"tGzv3JOkF0XG5Qx2TlKWIA",
   "example_parameter":"example_value"
}
```

and the following JSON redactor configuration,

```xml
<JSONRedactor>
    <RedactMime mimeType="application/json"/>
    <JSONPath path="**.access_token"/>
    <JSONPath path="**.refresh_token"/>
</JSONRedactor>
```

the JSON message is redacted and stored in the traffic monitoring database as follows:

```xml
{
  "access_token":null,
  "token_type":"example",
  "expires_in":3600,
  "refresh_token":null,
  "example_parameter":"example_value"
}
```

## Redact XML message content

You can redact specific XML content from a message by configuring XML elements or attributes to be removed. For example, to redact all the children of an element named `axway:sensitive_data`, where `xmlns:axway` is `axway.com/`, you can use the following syntax:

```xml
<XMLRedactedElement localname="sensitive_data" namespace="http://axway.com"
  redactionDisposition="redactChildren"/>
```

You can specify the following XML redaction directives:

* `redactChildren`: Removes all children of a specified element
* `redactElement`: Redacts the specified element and all its descendants
* `redactText`: Removes all text nodes from the specified element
* `redactDescendants`: Redacts children and text descendants of the specified node
* `redactAttributes`:  Removes the specified attributes

The `redactAttributes` directive is the default value if `redactionDisposition` is not specified in the `XMLRedactedElement` configuration node.

If you need to redact attributes of the specified node, you can configure this using `XMLRedactedAttribute` (child of `XMLRedactedElement`). `XMLRedactedElement` has two mandatory attributes, `localname` and `namespace`, which have the same meaning for `XMLRedactedAttribute`.

An empty XML namespace name is the same as the default document namespace.

### XML redactor configuration

You can specify the following properties in the `XMLRedactor` tag:

| Name          | Type   | Default value | Description                                           |
| ------------- | ------ | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| maxBufferSize | number | 32768         | Maximum memory size (in bytes) used by XML redaction. |
| maxDepth      | number | 1024          | Maximum depth of XML nested nodes.                    |

For example:

```xml
<XMLRedactor maxBufferSize="32768" maxDepth="1024">
   <RedactMime mimeType="application/xml"/>
   ...
</XMLRedactor>
```

If an error occurs during the redaction process, including `maxBufferSize` or `maxDepth` reached, the XML redactor redacts the rest of the XML data being processed to avoid writing sensitive data to the logs.

The following example from `redaction.xml` removes all children from `a_namespace:a_name`. It also removes the `an_attribute_name` and `another_attribute_name` attributes:

```xml
<XMLRedactor>
   <RedactMime mimeType="application/xml"/>
   <RedactMime mimeType="text/xml"/>
   <!--Remove children of a_namespace:a_name and some attributes-->
   <XMLRedactedElement localname="a_name" namespace="a_namespace"
     redactionDisposition="redactChildren">
     <XMLRedactedAttribute localname="an_attribute_name" namespace="an_attribute_namespace"/>
     <XMLRedactedAttribute localname="another_attribute_name" namespace="o"/>
   </XMLRedactedElement>
</XMLRedactor>
```

The following example removes the `b:a` element and all its children:

```xml
<XMLRedactor>
   <RedactMime mimeType="application/xml"/>
   <RedactMime mimeType="text/xml"/>
   <!---Remove element b:a and all its descendants-->
   <XMLRedactedElement localname="a" namespace="b" redactionDisposition="redactElement"/>
</XMLRedactor>
```

#### Example: Redact a WS-Security username token from an XML message

This section shows an end-to-end example of redacting a WS-Security user name token. Given the following XML request message,

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Envelope xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope">
 <Header>
  <Security xmlns="http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/2004/01/
    oasis-200401-wss-wssecurity-secext-1.0.xsd">
    <UsernameToken>
      <Username>root</Username>
      <Password Type="http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/2004/01/
         oasis-200401-wss-username-token-profile-1.0#PasswordDigest">EVfkjdkljla=
      </Password>
      <Nonce>tKUH8ab3Rokm4t6IAlgcdg9yaEw=</Nonce>
      <Created xmlns="http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/2004/01/
         oasis-200401-wss-wssecurity-utility-1.0.xsd">2010-08-10T10:52:42Z
      </Created>
    </UsernameToken>
  </Security>
 </Header>
 <Body>
  <SomeRequest xmlns="http://example.ns.com/foo/bar" />
 </Body>
</Envelope>
```

and the following XML redactor configuration,

```xml
<XMLRedactor>
    <RedactMime mimeType="text/xml" />
    <XMLRedactedElement localname="UsernameToken"
        namespace="http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/2004/01/
          oasis-200401-wss-wssecurity-secext-1.0.xsd
          "redactionDisposition="redactChildren">
    </XMLRedactedElement>
</XMLRedactor>
```

the XML message is redacted and stored in the traffic monitoring database as follows:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Envelope xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope">
 <Header>
  <Security xmlns="http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/2004/01/
    oasis-200401-wss-wssecurity-secext-1.0.xsd">
      <UsernameToken></UsernameToken>
  </Security>
 </Header>
 <Body>
  <SomeRequest xmlns="http://example.ns.com/foo/bar" />
 </Body>
</Envelope>
```

## Redact HTML form message content

You can redact the content of specific HTML form fields by configuring the fields to be removed. The following shows an example from `redaction.xml`:

```xml
<FormRedactor>
    <RedactMime mimeType="application/x-www-form-urlencoded"/>
    <FormField value="credit_card" action="obfuscate"/>
    <FormField value="phone_number" action="remove"/>
</FormRedactor>
```

This example obfuscates the contents of `credit_card` and removes `phone_number` form fields from the message.

The following are HTML form content types supported:

* `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
* `multipart/form-data`

These content types can be configured either in the same `FormRedaction` section, or in a separate `FormRedaction` section, where only the configured fields for their corresponding section will be used.

If the `action` tag is not present, the default action is then `replace`, and if tag `replaceBy` is not present, redaction replaces `multipart/form-data` values by an empty string, and `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` values by the string `null`.

For the `multipart/form-data` content, the `action` type `remove` does not remove the parameter name, only the parameter value is removed.

## Redact raw message content

API Gateway uses the `pcrepattern` ([PCRE](https://www.pcre.org/original/doc/html/pcrepattern.html)) regular expression engine. You can redact specific plain text by configuring regular expressions to define the content to be removed.

Because your REGEX is embedded in XML attributes, you must escape some special characters in your expressions by replacing them with XML character entities. For example:

* Single quotation marks are escaped as `&apos;`
* Double quotation marks are escaped as `&quot;`
* Ampersands are escaped as `&amp;`
* Left angle brackets are escaped as `&lt;`
* Right angle brackets are escaped as `&gt;`

It is recommended that you test your REGEX against some sample messages with one of the many online REGEX testers that are capable of testing PCRE expressions before escaping it.

The following shows a configuration example:

```xml
<RawRedactor>
     <RedactMime mimeType="text/plain"/>
     <Regex exp="creditcard\s*=\s*(\d{16})" redact="1" icase="true"/>
     <Regex exp="source:\b(\d{1,3})\.(\d{1,3})\.(\d{1,3})\.(\d{1,3})\b" redact="1,2" icase="true"/>
     <Regex exp="\d{16}" redact="0" icase="false" />
</RawRedactor>
```

In this configuration model, the `Regex` element includes the following attributes to define the redactor behavior:

* `exp`: Regular expression used to match the desired content. Possible values are valid regular expressions.
* `redact`: Specifies which groups in the match are redacted. Possible values are comma-separated lists of group indexes (for example, `1` or `1,2` or `4,6,7`, and so on). You can specify `0` to redact the entire match.
* `icase`: Specifies whether the match is case insensitive. Possible values are `true` (case insensitive) and `false` (case sensitive).
* `multi`: Specifies whether the match is multi-line. In multi-line mode, `^` and `$` match the beginning and the end of any line within the redacted text. Defaults to `false`.
* `utf`: Specifies whether the data being parsed is checked for valid UTF-8 characters. Defaults to `true`. `RawRedactor` cannot be used with non-UTF-8 characters.

### Optimize and make regular expressions more efficient

Regular expressions should be optimized to avoid poor performance and excessive use of resources, such as memory, stack, and CPU. See the [PCRE](https://www.pcre.org/original/doc/html/pcreperform.html) documentation for recommendations on how to ensure that your regular expressions are written correctly.

To make your regular expressions more efficient, follow these tips:

* Avoid using [excessive recursion](https://www.pcre.org/original/doc/html/pcrepattern.html#SEC23) and [back references](https://www.pcre.org/original/doc/html/pcrepattern.html#SEC19) in your patterns as much as possible.
* Use [non-greedy patterns](https://www.pcre.org/original/doc/html/pcrepattern.html#SEC17) when possible.
* Use multiple regex patterns instead of one complex pattern. Simple, specific patterns are more efficient than combining multiple patterns into a single expression with alternation. Alternation might consume excessive stack memory.

Using recursive patterns might cause the stack to overflow, which has resulted in crashes. At startup, API Gateway evaluates the maximum recursion limit to use. To prevent crashes, that maximum recursion limit is dynamically lowered whenever the stack size is estimated to be dangerously low.

### Example: Redact credit card details from raw text

This section shows some configured regular expressions and the behavior with specific raw message content.

The following expression specifies to redact a defined group:

```xml
<Regex exp="creditcard\s*=\s*(\d{16})" redact="1" icase="false"/>
```

The following shows example message content and the behavior with this expression:

|Message content|Behavior|
|---------------|--------|
|`&creditcard=1234123412341234`|Content matches expression. Defined group 1 `(\d{16})` is redacted (in this case, `1234123412341234`).|

The following expression specifies to redact multiple defined groups:

```xml
<Regex exp="ccdigits:(\d{1,4})\.(\d{1,4})\.(\d{1,4})\.(\d{1,4})" redact="1,2,3" icase="false"/>
```

The following shows example message content and the behavior with this expression:

|Message content|Behavior|
|---------------|--------|
|`ccdigits:1234.2345.3456.4567`|Content matches expression. Defined groups 1 `(\d{1,4})`, 2 `(\d{1,4}))`, and 3 `(\d{1,4})` are redacted (in this case `1234`, `2345`, and `3456`. Defined group 4 `(\d{1,4})` is left intact (in this case `4567`).|

The following expression specifies to redact content using case insensitivity:

```xml
<Regex exp="creditcard\s*=\s*(\d{16})" redact="1" icase="true"/>
```

The following shows example message content and the behavior with this expression:

|Message content|Behavior|
|---------------|--------|
|`credit card 123456781234567`|Content matches expression. Entire match (`credit card 1234567812345678`) is redacted.|
|`Credit Card 1234567812345678`|Content matches expression because of the `icase` attribute. Entire match (`Credit Card 1234567812345678`) is redacted.|

## Redact trace log records

You can redact API Gateway trace log records by configuring regular expressions to define content to be removed at a [trace level](/docs/apim_administration/apigtw_admin/tracing). This configuration applies to trace records equal or lower than the level configured. For example, `INFO` level redacts messages at levels `INFO`, `DEBUG`, and `DATA`.

Because your REGEX is embedded in XML attributes, you must escape some special characters in your expressions by replacing them with XML character entities. For example:

* Single quotation marks are escaped as `&apos;`
* Double quotation marks are escaped as `&quot;`
* Ampersands are escaped as `&amp;`
* Left angle brackets are escaped as `&lt;`
* Right angle brackets are escaped as `&gt;`

It is recommended that you test your REGEX against some sample messages with one of the many online REGEX testers that are capable of testing PCRE expressions before escaping it.

The following shows a configuration example, at an `INFO` trace level, which uses `Regex` elements already defined in the [Redact raw message content](#redact-raw-message-content) section.

```xml
<TraceRedactor level="INFO">
        <Regex exp="creditcard\s*=\s*(\d{16})" redact="1" icase="true"/>
        <Regex exp="source:\b(\d{1,3})\.(\d{1,3})\.(\d{1,3})\.(\d{1,3})\b" redact="1,2" icase="true"/>
        <Regex exp="\d{16}" redact="0" icase="false" />
</TraceRedactor>
```

The attributes of some `Regex` element have a different default behavior from raw redaction:

* `multi`: Specifies whether the match is multi-line. In multi-line mode, `^` will matches the beginning of the line and `$` matches the end of line. Defaults to `true`.
* `utf`: Specifies whether the data being parsed is checked for valid UTF-8 characters. Defaults to `false`. Some trace records at DATA level are to include binary data. Setting it to `true` will result in an error being logged for any record containing non-UTF-8 characters. Note that a PCRE command `(*UTF)` can be used at the beginning of the pattern to enable this feature at redaction time. This will result in no error logged but no redaction applied when non-UTF-8 characters are part of the data being redacted.

Redaction for trace log records works as follows:

* Applies for a single trace log record.
* Executes sequentially in the order the regular expressions are declared. For example, when an expression matches, the matching parts are removed and the resulting string will be the input for the next regular expression.
* Replaces only the `text/data` part of the record. For example, the prefix `LEVEL date [ids]` is not taken into account.
* Most of the startup messages are not redacted because redaction only starts when the service is loaded.

## Redact sensitive data from log files

Redaction rules do not apply to domain audit and access logs. For details on how to redact sensitive data from domain audit log and access log files, see:

* [Configure API Gateway logging and events](/docs/apim_administration/apigtw_admin/logging).
* [Transaction access log settings](/docs/apim_reference/log_global_settings#transaction-access-log-setting).
