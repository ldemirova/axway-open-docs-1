## Customize API Catalog settings

You can customize the following in the API Catalog view of API Portal:

* Display APIs in a list or tile view.
* Show or hide the button that enables users to download API definitions. Defaults to shown.
* Show or hide the button that enables users to download client SDKs. Defaults to hidden.
* Hide tags from API Catalog.
* Show only APIs associated with specified tags. For more details on tags, see [Group APIs with tags](#group-apis-with-tags).
* Hide APIs associated with specified tags. For more details on tags, see [Group APIs with tags](#group-apis-with-tags).
* Show only APIs associated with specified statuses.
* Show or hide the button that enables users to try out an API. You can show the button for all users, for authenticated users only, hide it for APIs with specific tags, or hide it completely. The default is shown for all users. For more details on Try-it button visibility see Customize Try-it button visibility.
* Set a payload size (in KB). If the response is bigger than the configured value, the response is downloaded as file. Defaults to blank, which means that downloads are disabled.
* Swagger UI layout of REST APIs. You can choose from:

    * **Multi-column**: A Two-column view, in which methods are listed on the left side, and the details of a selected method are listed on the right side. This is the default option in JAI.
    * **Single-column**: The official layout shipped with the Swagger UI.
* Define the maximum number of endpoints that can be rendered in multi-column layout. When this limit is exceeded, the layout automatically switches from multi-column to single-column. Defaults to 30 endpoints.
* Show or hide code examples in endpoint details when using Amplify rendering tool. Defaults to `shown`.
* Show or hide `externalDocs` along with its description.
* Choose colors for the different methods.

The following image shows the API Catalog options in JAI.

### Change API details page settings in T4 template

## Customize source of API descriptions in Purity III

You can customize API Portal to show summaries, instead of descriptions, for APIs, to provide the App developer a quicker summary view of what the API is about instead of a long description. Using description can also have a performance impact, so it is best to use summary to improve the performance of the API Catalog view.

To change the settings:

1. Log in to JAI (`https://<API Portal_host>/administrator`).
2. Click **Components > API Portal > Additional Settings**.
3. In the **API Information Source** field, select `Description` or `Summary`.

You can directly edit API Catalog page title and summary from T4 Page Builder. For more information, see [Customizations with T4 Page Builder](/docs/apim_administration/apiportal_admin/customize_getting_started/#customizations-with-t4---pagebuilder).

## Group APIs with tags

You can add tags to APIs in API Manager and use them to split your API Catalog into smaller subsets. For example, you can create multiple themed API groups based on your developer communities.

For more details on adding tags to APIs, see the [API Manager User Guide](/docs/apim_administration/apimgr_admin/).

### Create an API Catalog using Purity III

2. Click **Menus > Main Menu > Add New Menu Item**.
3. Enter a menu title for the new API Catalog.

   * To access all your API Catalogs under the **APIs** menu item rather than additional menu items, set **Parent Item** to **APIs**.
7. On the **API Catalog** tab, in **Show APIs with tags**, enter the tags to include in this API Catalog.
8. On the **API Catalog** tab, in **Do not show APIs with tags**, enter the tags to exclude in this API Catalog.
9. On the **Page Display** tab, you can change the page title and summary text. For more details, see [Customize page title and summary](/docs/apim_administration/apiportal_admin/customize_page_content/#customize-page-title-and-summary).
10. Click **Save & Close**.

### Create an API Catalog using T4 template

To create a dedicated API Catalog in **T4 template** for a subset of tagged APIs, follow these steps:

1. Log in to Joomla! Administrator Interface (JAI).
2. Click **Content > Site Modules**.
3. Select the following modules: API Catalog List, API Catalog Layout Switch, API Catalog Search Box, API Catalog Sorting, then click **Duplicate** from the **Actions** button.

9. Enter title for the new API Catalog page and click on the **Save as copy** button.
10. Click **Edit** from the **Page Content** tab.
    The page is opened in **T4 Page Builder**. In the structure of the page you will see four modules: API Catalog List, API Catalog Layout Switch, API Catalog Search Box, and API Catalog Sorting.
11. Replace the modules from the previous page with the duplicated modules from step 3. To do so, click on each module and from the right -side toolbox that is shown, select the duplicated module from the **Module** drop-down.
12. Click **Save** and **Close**.
13. From **Components > T4 Page Builder > All Pages** click **Add menu item** button that is shown on the row of the newly created page from step 10.

17. Set **Access** to the level you wish, and ensure that **Status** is set to `Published`.
18. In **Ordering**, select where in the main menu you want to display the new API Catalog. The menu item is placed after the item you select in here.
19. Click **Create New Menu**.

Your themed API Catalog is now ready, and you can see it in your API Portal.

You can also choose to use some tags as an internal tool, and hide them from the API consumers. To hide tags, On the **API Catalog** tab, in **Hide tags**, enter the tags to hide.

### Create tags with wildcards

You can add tags using the `*` and `?` wildcards. This is helpful to list only development APIs in one API Catalog and production APIs in another. In this case you can filter them using wildcards as follows: `*dev*` will list APIs which contain `dev` somewhere in the tag, for example, `financial_development` and `development` tags. Or, to hide all tags which start with `test` and end with any other letter, for example, `test` or `tests`, you can do `test?`.

## Customize the Try-it button visibility

You can customize the **Try-it** button for a specific API Catalog. For **Purity III**, follow these steps:

1. In JAI, click **Menus > Main Menu > APIs**.
2. Click the **API Catalog** tab.
3. Select one of the options from the **Show Inline Try-it** list to set the **Try-it** button visibility.

   * **Yes always** - The **Try-it** button will always be displayed. This is the default option.
   * **Yes only for authenticated users** - The **Try-it** button will be visible only for authenticated users.
   * **No for APIs with the following tags** - The **Try-it** button will be hidden for APIs with specific tags. When this option is selected, a new field, **Hide Inline Try-it for APIs with tags**, is shown. In this field, you can choose for which tags the **Try-it** button will be hidden. You can enter multiple tags by separating them by coma. Wildcard symbols (`?` and `*`) are allowed in this field.
   * **Never** - The **Try-it**  button will always be hidden.
4. Click **Save**.
