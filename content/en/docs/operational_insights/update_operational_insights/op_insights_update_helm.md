If a new Elastic version is installed as a result of an upgrade, you must ensure that you have at least three Elasticsearch nodes running in the cluster. This is to ensure that a new master node can be selected during the upgrade and that updated nodes can join the cluster.

Example how to upgrade an existing release:

```none
helm upgrade -n apim-elk -f myvalues.yaml axway-elk ($PLACEHOLDER))
```
